title: Ban & phase out
---

As a starting point, the treaty must include binding, global bans and phase-outs of problematic
and avoidable plastic products and chemicals of concern. Priority must be those that are most harmful to human health and the environment and can be immediately banned and gradually phased out. The treaty must include global criteria and initial lists to identify and specify these plastic products and chemicals.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the treaty’s inclusion of global bans and phase-out requirements to eliminate the production, consumption, and trade of problematic
and avoidable plastic products and chemicals of concern, which are identified and specified through global criteria and lists.

States’ convergence on the need to eliminate these plastic products and chemicals is taken as one of the indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution. WWF’s [statement on the treaty must-haves (pdf)](paste link here) provides further information on global bans and phaseouts, as one of the four essential elements in the treaty that together provide a strong starting point and a credible, well-supported pathway to end plastic pollution.


## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of global bans and phase-out requirements to eliminate the production, consumption and trade of problematic and avoidable plastic products and chemicals of concern.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for the treaty’s inclusion of global bans and phaseouts of problematic and avoidable plastic products and chemicals of concern, which are identified and specified through global criteria and lists.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of global bans and phaseouts of problematic and avoidable plastic products and chemicals of concern, which are identified and specified through global criteria and lists.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of global bans and phase-outs of any plastic category of concern in their latest verbal or written public statement.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.
