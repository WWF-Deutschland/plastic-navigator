title: Must-haves in the treaty
---

To ensure that world leaders deliver the treaty that people and nature need, WWF identified four essential elements that – as a starting point – states must secure at the end of the negotiation process.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the inclusion of the four essential elements in the treaty, namely:

* Global bans and phase-outs of the most harmful plastics and associated chemicals;
* Binding global product design requirements and systems for the transition toward a non-toxic circular economy;
* Aligned financial flows and sufficient resources for systems change, including a comprehensive finance package; and
* Evidence-based and decision-making mechanisms that guarantee measures can be adapted and strengthened over time.

_Explore the various elements in further detail in the topics tab above._

States’ convergence on the need for all four essential elements in the treaty is taken to indicate their support for an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution. WWF’s [statement on the treaty must-haves (pdf)](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/a-global-treaty-to-end-plastic-pollution-must-haves.pdf) provides further information on the four essential elements in the treaty that together provide a strong starting point and a credible, well-supported pathway to end plastic pollution.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of four essential elements in the treaty, which together stipulate binding, global obligations on the most problematic and concerning issues across the full plastic lifecycle, necessary means of implementation, and mechanisms to strengthen the treaty over time.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for all four must-have elements in the treaty to end plastic pollution.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for all four must-have elements in the treaty to end plastic pollution.
* Lighter green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for some of the four must-have elements in the treaty to end plastic pollution.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of any of the four must-have elements in the treaty to end plastic pollution.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.
