### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
