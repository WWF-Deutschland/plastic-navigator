The treaty must establish binding, global requirements on product design and performance
to ensure reduction, reuse, and safe recycling for the remaining plastics. Establishing these requirements must go hand-in-hand with a dedicated focus on setting up the systems needed to enable collection, reuse and recycling. As a starting point, the measures should target products that are consumed in high volumes, likely to become pollution and cause more harm due to their design, such as beverage bottles and food containers. Initial requirements should focus on priority plastic products’ reusability and recyclability, on recycled plastics, and on setting up essential systems to facilitate the circular economy transition.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the treaty’s inclusion of global product design requirements and systems for the transition toward a non-toxic circular economy.

States’ convergence on the need to ensure a non-toxic circular economy of plastics, through product design requirements and systems, is taken as one of the indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution. WWF’s [statement on the treaty must-haves (pdf)](paste link here) provides further information on global product design requirements and systems, as one of the four essential elements in the treaty that together provide a strong starting point and a credible, well-supported pathway to end plastic pollution.


## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of global product design requirements and systems for the transition toward a non-toxic cricular economy.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for the treaty’s inclusion of global product design requirements and systems for the transition toward a non-toxic cricular economy.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of global product design requirements and systems for the transition toward a non-toxic cricular economy.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of any global product design requirements and systems for the transition toward a non-toxic cricular economy in their latest verbal or written public statement.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.
