title: Implementation support
---

The treaty must include a comprehensive finance package that leverages all available sources
and aligns financial flows, including public and private financing, with the objectives of the
treaty and the implementation of its measures. This package will ensure predictable, adequate,
equitable and accessible financial support to enable all parties to effectively implement the treaty.

To complement the financial package, the treaty should ensure the provision of non-financial resources to enable effective implementation, particularly through technology transfer, technical assistance and capacity building.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the treaty’s inclusion of mechanisms to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations.

States’ convergence on the need to ensure necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations is taken as one of the indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution.


## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of mechanisms to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for the treaty’s inclusion of a comprehensive finance package, and complementary technical assistance and technology transfers, to enable countries' effective implementation of their obligations.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of a comprehensive finance package, and complementary technical assistance and technology transfers, to enable countries' effective implementation of their obligations.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of a comprehensive finance package, and complementary technical assistance and technology transfers, to enable countries' effective implementation of their obligations.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
