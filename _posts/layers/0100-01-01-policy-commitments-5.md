title: Global Strengthening

The treaty must include mechanisms to allow for the strengthening of control measures and implementation measures beyond the treaty’s adoption. To achieve the goal of ending plastic pollution, states must progressively expand and dial up their efforts over time, beyond the initial priority measures, in accordance with emerging scientific evidence, assessments and monitoring of the treaty’s effectiveness.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the inclusion of:

* Evidence-based mechanisms to report, assess and review progress and effectiveness of measures, and potential necessary improvements;
* Effective decision-making mechanisms, including in the absence of consensus among parties, to enable future adoption of necessary amendments to strengthen the treaty

States’ convergence on the need for evidence-based and decision-making mechanisms, that guarantee measures can be adapted and strengthened over time, is taken as one of the indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution. WWF’s [statement on the treaty must-haves (pdf)](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/a-global-treaty-to-end-plastic-pollution-must-haves.pdf) provides further information on the four essential elements in the treaty that together provide a strong starting point and a credible, well-supported pathway to end plastic pollution.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of evidence-based mechanisms to report, assess and review progress, and effective decision-making mechanisms to enable future adoption of necessary amendments and strengthen the treaty over time.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for the treaty’s inclusion of evidence-based mechanisms to report, assess and review progress, and effective decision-making mechanisms to enable future adoption of necessary amendments and strengthen the treaty over time.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of evidence-based mechanisms to report, assess and review progress, and effective decision-making mechanisms to enable future adoption of necessary amendments and strengthen the treaty over time.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of mechanisms to enable future adoption of necessary amendments and strengthen the treaty over time.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.

The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
